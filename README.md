# imise-beamertheme
Compile with `pdflatex template.tex` (twice on the first run), `xelatex template.tex` or `tectonic template.tex`.
Repeat this the first time for correct placement of the graphical elements.

Also [available on OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ncgkzkctvxdb), where you can clone it, but it may be outdated there.

New LaTeX beamer presentation theme with the IMISE corporate identity, which is mandatory for student presentations.
This is an alternative to the power point templates for fellow LaTeX users.

The old XeLaTeX beamer theme that was in use until October 2018 can be found at https://github.com/IMISE/imise-beamertheme-old.

## Tested

Successfully tested on OverLeaf and on Arch Linux with pdflatex from texlive-most 2019 and 2023 and also with XeLaTeX and tectonic, which is derived from XeTeX.
Fonts may differ between pdflatex and XeLaTeX/tectonic.
